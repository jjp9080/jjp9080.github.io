        In <span class = "changehighlight" style = "font-size: 30px">1976</span>, NASA asked the general public to submit 
        proposals for possible experiments to be carried out via 
        satellite. Kit Galloway and Sherrie Rabinowitz both had an interest 
        in telecommunications infrastructure. So they began to develop a way to 
        interact across distance through satellite transmission with the Satellite Arts Project. 
        Also known as <span class = "changehighlight" style = "font-size: 30px">“A Space With No Geographical Boundaries”</span>, this project used telecollaborative 
        <span class = "changehighlight" style = "font-size: 30px">dance</span>and <span class = "changehighlight" style = "font-size: 30px">music</span>to connect over a long distance. Several performing artists, who were 
        separated by oceans and geography, could stand and perform together in the <span class = "changehighlight" style = "font-size: 30px">same live image</span>. 
        After extensive storyboarding and planning, Galloway and Rabinowitz decided to create 
        composite images from each location so that the remote participants could all join together 
        onscreen. This was referred to as “The Image as Place”. Also, in order to combat possible time
         delays due to the long distance, the artists came up with timing exercises and played around
          with the delay to produce <span class = "changehighlight" style = "font-size: 30px">sonic</span> and <span class = "changehighlight" style = "font-size: 30px">visual effects</span> instead. This is where you can see the
         blurry effect of these photos.

            I thought this project was so well done. The <a href = "https://player.vimeo.com/video/436193481" class = "changehighlight"><span>video</span></a> shows how they started from a split screen to combining them eventually to show a full image, which I thought was amazing considering the time period this was in. 
            The images are somewhat blurry, but I think it is much more artistic in this way. 
            There are certain moments where it focuses, and I appreciated the contrast. 
            Galloway and Rabinowitz really pushed the limitations of technologies and found new ways 
            to create art through telecommunication. It is fascinating that people from different locations 
            can create art together like this.
