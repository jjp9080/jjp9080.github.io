        Kit Galloway and Sherrie Rabinowitz ran with the concept of <span class = "changehighlight" style = "font-size: 30px">interconnecting</span> 5 locations in the
        Los Angeles area through state-of-the-art telecommunicative devices. This included drawing tablets, a computer
        messaging system, and of course, telephones. Likewise to a café, the conventions were open for 6 hrs a day for
        7 weeks. Customers would be able to <span class = "changehighlight" style = "font-size: 30px">post any desired text or images</span>, participate in discussions, and even <span class = "changehighlight" style = "font-size: 30px">alter</span>material made from
        other customers at other café sites. This project was a part of the Olympic Arts Festival, a citywide celebration of <span class = "changehighlight" style = "font-size: 30px">“International 
        Brotherhood</span>."

        I found this concept project to be especially creative, considering it takes a universally known place like a cafe
        and remodels it into a celebration for digital interaction. It’s a common phrase to go, 
        “grab a coffee” with someone, and the <a href ="https://vimeo.com/343482784/60cbe443f1" class = "changehighlight"><span>idea</span></a>of conversing 
        with people from the same branch cafe in other places expands the conversations and 
        interactions that can occur in an already bustling coffee shop.
