        Since the <span class = "changehighlight" style = "font-size: 30px">1970s</span>, with the advent of satellite technology (even before the Internet), 
        artists have been <span class = "changehighlight" style = "font-size: 30px">exploring</span>a third space as an environment for art making and live events. 
        One of the most important works of art was the "Hole in Space" by American artists Kit 
        Galloway and Sherrie Rabinowitz, who in 1980  <span class = "changehighlight" style = "font-size: 30px">established a remote embrace</span> in a third space 
        by connecting New York and California via satellite before anyone could witness a video 
        conference. This unannounced effort invited passersby to stand in front of a large screen 
        and communicate with people <span class = "changehighlight" style = "font-size: 30px">3,000 miles away</span>.

        This experiment demonstrates how early telecommunications infrastructure connected people communicating 
        across long distances in two places. I was surprised that the <a href = "https://player.vimeo.com/video/436193313" class = "changehighlight"><span>public</span></a> learned the use of the 
        device without any instruction and quickly spread the word among the group. But in the 1980s, 
        broadband speed was a major factor in how to achieve real-time public communication from place 
        to place. This experiment is like the prototype of our current interactive communication 
        in real time using facetime or zoom.
