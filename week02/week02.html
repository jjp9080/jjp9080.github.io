               Taking place after the war, Bush first discusses about what benefits and uses science has brought to the world thus far. 
               It has improved so many factors, from food to clothing and even an increased span of life.  I also liked how Bush discussed different
               types of scientific/machine discoveries that make our everyday lives easier. He goes into detail on the development of photographs, which used to be 
               much harder than it is now. Science has become much larger, and it is no longer the "mere extraction of data" anymore. Science is now used
               in our everyday lives, and technology even more so. Back then it was a given that things took time, and no one complained when a telegraph or a letter arrived late.
               But now with the increase of faster and more improved technology, people feel the need to have quicker, better, and smoother technology. This is the reason why
               there are constantly new versions of all kinds of technological devices. It is not good for the environment at all, but I believe that people have the tendency to want
               more. People depend on technology because it can process information accurately.
